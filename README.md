Exploring Code from The Rust Book
====

The virtual workspace `Cargo.toml` in this directory lists the currently available projects. There are debug targets for each in the `.vscode/launch.json` config.

In general, you should read the excellent [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) and consult [Rust by Example](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-by-example) and [The Rust Cookbook](https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/rust-cookbook/about.html) before looking at my very personal exploration code here.
